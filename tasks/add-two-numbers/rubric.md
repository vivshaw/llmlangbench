# Review Rubric: Add Two Numbers

Evaluate the submitted code on the following dimensions:

- **Correctness** (0-25): Does it correctly add two numbers, including negatives and floats?
- **Readability** (0-25): Is the code clear and well-structured?
- **Idiom usage** (0-25): Does it use language-appropriate patterns? For example: type annotations in Python, proper module structure in Rust, etc.
- **Simplicity** (0-25): Is it minimal? This is a simple task — the solution should be proportionally simple. Deduct heavily for over-engineering.

Deduct points for:
- Unnecessary type conversions or validation (the runner handles I/O)
- Overly complex project structure for a one-function task
- Unused imports, dead code, or excessive comments
- Not following the language's standard conventions
