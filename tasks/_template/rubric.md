- **Correctness** (0-25): Does the implementation satisfy all requirements in the spec?
- **Readability** (0-25): Is the code clear, well-structured, and easy to follow?
- **Idiom usage** (0-25): Does it use language-appropriate patterns, conventions, and standard library features?
- **Simplicity** (0-25): Is the solution as simple as possible? No unnecessary abstractions, over-engineering, or dead code?
